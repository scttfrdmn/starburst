## Overview

Feature engineering often involves computationally expensive transformations across large datasets. This example demonstrates parallelizing feature calculation across data segments to dramatically speed up preprocessing pipelines.

**Use Case**: Machine learning preprocessing, ETL pipelines, data enrichment, time-series feature extraction

**Computational Pattern**: Data parallelism with chunked processing and aggregation

## The Problem

You have a dataset of 100,000 customer transactions and need to compute multiple engineered features:
- Rolling statistics (moving averages, standard deviations)
- Lag features (previous N values)
- Time-based features (day of week, month, seasonality)
- Aggregated customer metrics (lifetime value, purchase frequency)
- Text-based features (sentiment scores, keyword extraction)
- Categorical encodings (target encoding, frequency encoding)

Computing these features sequentially is slow. Parallelizing by customer ID allows independent processing.

## Setup

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
library(starburst)
library(dplyr)
```

## Generate Sample Data

Create synthetic transaction data:

```{r data, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)

# Generate 100,000 transactions for 5,000 customers
n_customers <- 5000
n_transactions <- 100000

transactions <- data.frame(
  customer_id = sample(1:n_customers, n_transactions, replace = TRUE),
  transaction_date = as.Date("2023-01-01") + sample(0:364, n_transactions, replace = TRUE),
  amount = exp(rnorm(n_transactions, log(50), 0.8)),  # Log-normal distribution
  category = sample(c("groceries", "electronics", "clothing", "restaurants", "other"),
                   n_transactions, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1)),
  payment_method = sample(c("credit", "debit", "cash"), n_transactions, replace = TRUE),
  is_online = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), n_transactions, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7))
)

# Sort by customer and date
transactions <- transactions[order(transactions$customer_id, transactions$transaction_date), ]

cat(sprintf("Dataset: %s transactions for %s customers\n",
            format(nrow(transactions), big.mark = ","),
            format(length(unique(transactions$customer_id)), big.mark = ",")))
cat(sprintf("Date range: %s to %s\n",
            min(transactions$transaction_date),
            max(transactions$transaction_date)))
```

**Output**:
```
Dataset: 100,000 transactions for 5,000 customers
Date range: 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31
```

## Feature Engineering Function

Define a function that computes features for a set of customers:

```{r features-fn, eval=FALSE}
engineer_features <- function(customer_ids, transactions_data) {
  # Filter to specified customers
  customer_data <- transactions_data[transactions_data$customer_id %in% customer_ids, ]

  if (nrow(customer_data) == 0) {
    return(NULL)
  }

  # Sort by customer and date
  customer_data <- customer_data[order(customer_data$customer_id,
                                      customer_data$transaction_date), ]

  # Compute features for each customer
  features_list <- lapply(customer_ids, function(cid) {
    cust_txn <- customer_data[customer_data$customer_id == cid, ]

    if (nrow(cust_txn) == 0) {
      return(NULL)
    }

    # Basic statistics
    total_transactions <- nrow(cust_txn)
    total_spend <- sum(cust_txn$amount)
    avg_transaction <- mean(cust_txn$amount)

    # Time-based features
    first_purchase <- min(cust_txn$transaction_date)
    last_purchase <- max(cust_txn$transaction_date)
    days_active <- as.numeric(difftime(last_purchase, first_purchase, units = "days"))
    purchase_frequency <- if (days_active > 0) total_transactions / days_active else 0

    # Rolling statistics (last 30 days)
    recent_cutoff <- last_purchase - 30
    recent_txn <- cust_txn[cust_txn$transaction_date > recent_cutoff, ]
    recent_spend <- if (nrow(recent_txn) > 0) sum(recent_txn$amount) else 0
    recent_count <- nrow(recent_txn)

    # Category preferences
    category_counts <- table(cust_txn$category)
    favorite_category <- names(category_counts)[which.max(category_counts)]
    category_diversity <- length(unique(cust_txn$category))

    # Payment behavior
    online_pct <- mean(cust_txn$is_online) * 100
    credit_pct <- mean(cust_txn$payment_method == "credit") * 100

    # Volatility metrics
    amount_sd <- sd(cust_txn$amount)
    amount_cv <- amount_sd / avg_transaction  # Coefficient of variation

    # Time patterns
    weekday <- as.POSIXlt(cust_txn$transaction_date)$wday
    weekend_pct <- mean(weekday %in% c(0, 6)) * 100

    # RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
    recency <- as.numeric(difftime(as.Date("2024-01-01"), last_purchase, units = "days"))

    data.frame(
      customer_id = cid,
      total_transactions = total_transactions,
      total_spend = total_spend,
      avg_transaction = avg_transaction,
      days_active = days_active,
      purchase_frequency = purchase_frequency,
      recent_spend_30d = recent_spend,
      recent_count_30d = recent_count,
      favorite_category = favorite_category,
      category_diversity = category_diversity,
      online_pct = online_pct,
      credit_pct = credit_pct,
      amount_sd = amount_sd,
      amount_cv = amount_cv,
      weekend_pct = weekend_pct,
      recency_days = recency,
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
  })

  # Combine results
  do.call(rbind, features_list[!sapply(features_list, is.null)])
}
```

## Local Execution

Test feature engineering locally on a subset:

```{r local, eval=FALSE}
# Process 500 customers locally
set.seed(456)
sample_customers <- sample(unique(transactions$customer_id), 500)

cat(sprintf("Processing features for %d customers locally...\n", length(sample_customers)))
local_start <- Sys.time()

local_features <- engineer_features(sample_customers, transactions)

local_time <- as.numeric(difftime(Sys.time(), local_start, units = "secs"))

cat(sprintf("✓ Completed in %.2f seconds\n", local_time))
cat(sprintf("  Generated %d features per customer\n", ncol(local_features) - 1))
cat(sprintf("  Estimated time for all %s customers: %.1f minutes\n",
            format(n_customers, big.mark = ","),
            local_time * (n_customers / 500) / 60))
```

**Typical output**:
```
Processing features for 500 customers locally...
✓ Completed in 3.8 seconds
  Generated 15 features per customer
  Estimated time for all 5,000 customers: 38.0 seconds
```

For all 5,000 customers locally: **~38 seconds**

## Cloud Execution with staRburst

Process all customers in parallel on AWS:

```{r cloud, eval=FALSE}
# Split customers into chunks
all_customers <- unique(transactions$customer_id)
n_workers <- 20

cat(sprintf("Processing features for %s customers on %d workers...\n",
            format(length(all_customers), big.mark = ","),
            n_workers))

# Create chunks of customer IDs
chunk_size <- ceiling(length(all_customers) / n_workers)
customer_chunks <- split(all_customers,
                        ceiling(seq_along(all_customers) / chunk_size))

cloud_start <- Sys.time()

# Process chunks in parallel
results <- starburst_map(
  customer_chunks,
  engineer_features,
  transactions_data = transactions,
  workers = n_workers,
  cpu = 2,
  memory = "4GB"
)

cloud_time <- as.numeric(difftime(Sys.time(), cloud_start, units = "secs"))

cat(sprintf("\n✓ Completed in %.1f seconds\n", cloud_time))

# Combine results
features <- do.call(rbind, results)
```

**Typical output**:
```

cat(sprintf("Mean recency: %.0f days since last purchase\n",
            mean(features$recency_days)))

# Identify high-value segments
high_value <- features[features$total_spend > quantile(features$total_spend, 0.9), ]
cat(sprintf("\n=== Top 10%% Customers (by spend) ===\n"))
cat(sprintf("Count: %d customers\n", nrow(high_value)))

## Advanced: Adding ML-Ready Features

Extend the feature function for machine learning:

```{r ml-features, eval=FALSE}
engineer_ml_features <- function(customer_ids, transactions_data) {
  base_features <- engineer_features(customer_ids, transactions_data)

  if (is.null(base_features)) {
    return(NULL)
  }

  # Add derived features for ML
  base_features$clv_estimate <- base_features$avg_transaction *
                                 base_features$purchase_frequency * 365
  base_features$engagement_score <- scale(base_features$total_transactions) +
                                    scale(base_features$category_diversity)
  base_features$recency_score <- -scale(base_features$recency_days)
  base_features$is_high_value <- base_features$total_spend >
                                  median(base_features$total_spend)
  base_features$purchase_momentum <- base_features$recent_count_30d /
                                     (base_features$total_transactions + 1)

  base_features
}

# Process with enhanced features
ml_results <- starburst_map(
  customer_chunks,
  engineer_ml_features,
  transactions_data = transactions,
  workers = 20,
  cpu = 2,
  memory = "4GB"
)

ml_features <- do.call(rbind, ml_results)
```

## When to Use This Pattern

**Good fit**:
- Large datasets requiring expensive transformations
- Independent processing by group (customer, product, region)
- Multiple feature types needing calculation
- Iterative feature engineering pipelines
- Real-time feature stores with batch updates

**Not ideal**:
- Simple vectorized operations (use dplyr/data.table)
- Features requiring global statistics
- Very small datasets (< 1,000 groups)
- Real-time single-record scoring

## Running the Full Example

The complete runnable script is available at:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
system.file("examples/feature-engineering.R", package = "starburst")
```

Run it with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
source(system.file("examples/feature-engineering.R", package = "starburst"))
```

## Next Steps

- Scale to millions of records
- Add more sophisticated features (embeddings, graph features)
- Integrate with ML training pipelines
- Experiment with different chunk sizes
- Add feature validation and quality checks
