\usage{
starburst_setup(
  region = "us-east-1",
  force = FALSE,
  use_public_base = TRUE,
  ecr_image_ttl_days = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{region}{AWS region (default: "us-east-1")}

\item{force}{Force re-setup even if already configured}

\item{use_public_base}{Use public base Docker images (default: TRUE).
Set to FALSE to build private base images in your ECR.}

\item{ecr_image_ttl_days}{Number of days to keep Docker images in ECR (default: NULL = never delete).
AWS will automatically delete images older than this many days.
This prevents surprise costs if you stop using staRburst.
Recommended: 30 days for regular users, 7 days for occasional users.
When images are deleted, they will be rebuilt on next use (adds 3-5 min).}

# Use private base images with 7-day cleanup
